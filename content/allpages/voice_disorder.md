          People develop voice problems for many reasons. Doctors who specialize in ear, nose and throat disorders and speech pathology specialists are involved in diagnosing and treating voice disorders.

          Treatment depends on what's causing your voice disorder, but may include voice therapy, medication, injections or surgery.

          ## Causes

          Your voice box (larynx) is made of cartilage, muscle and mucous membranes located at the top of your windpipe (trachea) and the base of your tongue. Your vocal cords are two flexible bands of muscle tissue that sit at the entrance of the windpipe. Sound is created when your vocal cords vibrate.

          This vibration comes from air moving through the larynx, bringing your vocal cords closer together. Your vocal cords also help close your voice box when you swallow, preventing you from inhaling food or liquid.

          If your vocal cords become inflamed, develop growths or become paralyzed, they can't work properly, and you may develop a voice disorder.

          Some common voice disorders include:

          * Laryngitis
          * Muscle tension dysphonia
          * Neurological voice disorders, such as spasmodic dysphonia
          * Polyps, nodules or cysts on the vocal cords (noncancerous lesions)
          * Precancerous and cancerous lesions
          * Vocal cord paralysis or weakness
          * White patches called leukoplakia

          ### Risk Factors

          Many risk factors can contribute to a voice disorder, including:

          * Aging
          * Alcohol use
          * Allergies
          * Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
          * Illnesses, such as colds or upper respiratory infections
          * Improper throat clearing over a long time
          * Neurological disorders
          * Psychological stress
          * Scarring from neck surgery or from trauma to the front of the neck
          * Screaming
          * Smoking
          * Throat cancer
          * Throat dehydration
          * Thyroid problems
