          Swollen lymph nodes or Lymphadenopathy refers to the swelling of lymph nodes which can be due to bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, malignancy or autoimmune disease. When your body's immune system works to eliminate infection and/or foreign viruses or bacteria, your lymph nodes may expand or get larger.


          These lymph nodes filter the germs and cells that passes through your lymph fluid. White blood cells, proteins, and fats make up the fluid known as lymph, which is clear or slightly yellowish in color.
