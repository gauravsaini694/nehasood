According to WHO, 360 million people
(approximately 5% of the world’s population) live with
disabling hearing loss and nearly 32 million of them
are children. It is estimated that over 60% of such
hearing loss could be avoided through preventive
measures.

Our sensory organs mediate the interaction between
a person and his or her surrounding environment.
The sense of hearing is one of the key senses which
helps us build language and speech and facilitates
social interaction. Normal hearing is mandatory for
the development of spoken language and cognitive
development of children.

Hearing loss in children affects their language
development along with their social skills and
academic achievements and also has a huge impact
on employment opportunities later in life.

Communication difficulties can have lasting
emotional and psychological consequences that can
lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness and
depression. The adverse effect of hearing loss is not
limited to the child but causes immense stress in the
families. The families are burdened with an
increased need for support for the child as well as
more financial expenses.

Without suitable interventions, hearing loss is a
barrier to both education and social integration and
normal development. In addition, children who have
hearing loss can benefit greatly from early
identification and appropriate interventions to treat
the hearing loss.

### HEARING LOSS IS A NEURODEVELOPMENTAL EMERGENCY IN CHILDREN

Early identification plays a key role in the successful
management of hearing loss in children. Early and
timely interventions help to minimize developmental
delays and promote communication, education and
MAXSCENE
social development. The Joint Committee on Infant
Hearing recommends that all children with hearing
loss should receive intervention by six months of age
at the latest.

All children undergo screening at birth with a test
called OAE (otoacoustic emissions).

As soon as parents suspect hearing loss or a speech
delay, a consultation should be done with your
doctor. Audiological assessment includes a BERA
test which can confirm the hearing loss. The sooner
a child is identified as having hearing loss and the
earlier he or she receives support, the greater the
possibility of the child learning spoken language.

### WHAT IS THE IDEAL TIME TO START TREATMENT?

The ideal time to start intervention is NOW!
Start the appropriate treatment as early as possible.

### HOW CAN HEARING LOSS BE TREATED?

Treatment depends on multiple factors
• Age
• Cause of hearing loss ( conductive or
sensorineural)
• Degree of hearing loss ( mild, moderate, severe,
Profound)
• Unilateral or bilateral
• General condition of the child

### CONDUCTIVE HEARING LOSS

Wax, ear infections like glue ear, or congenital
malformations of the ear (Microtia or atresia)
Removal of wax, giving medication for glue ear or the
use of ventilation tubes treats hearing loss.
In cases of congenital malformations, Bone
Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHA) are extremely
beneficial.

### SENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS

Mild to moderate hearing loss can be treated with
hearing aids.

In cases of severe to profound hearing loss Cochlear
Implantation is the most effective treatment giving
children normal hearing and subsequent normal
speech development.

Children who received a cochlear implant earlier had
better language outcomes.
